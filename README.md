# Fall_2024-Time-Series-Analysis-Final-Project
Jiajun Chen and Xinyue Chen's implementation of Kinetic Ising Model.
We added simulations for Mean field methods and other details.

## Reference

This work builds upon or utilizes components from the [SDKIM repository](https://github.com/carlocampajola/SDKIM/tree/SDKIM) by Carlo Campajola. SDKIM is an implementation for modeling time-varying interactions in complex systems using maximum likelihood estimation.

The repository provides:
- main Implementation for **KIM**.
- target estimation.
