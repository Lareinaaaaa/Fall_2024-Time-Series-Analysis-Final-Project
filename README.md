# A Comprehensive Revisit of the Score Driven Kinetic Ising Model in Time Series Analysis
This study revisits the Score-Driven Kinetic Ising Model (SDKIM), focusing on reproducing its theoretical framework and addressing underexplored aspects of parameter estimation. We implement a mean-field approximation method, which, although not detailed in the original work, facilitates efficient and scalable parameter estimation. The model's performance is evaluated on temporal network datasets, validating its robustness and effectiveness in capturing dynamic interactions. This revisit underscores SDKIM's potential as a practical tool for analyzing network dynamics while providing valuable insights into its implementation and application.

## Reference

This work builds upon or utilizes components from the [SDKIM repository](https://github.com/carlocampajola/SDKIM/tree/SDKIM) by Carlo Campajola. SDKIM is an implementation for modeling time-varying interactions in complex systems using maximum likelihood estimation.

The repository provides:
- Main Implementation for **KIM**
- Target estimation
